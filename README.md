A robotâ€™s (R) mission is to save planet earth and make sure all carbon mines (M) are closed. The robot can move directly between mines as long as it has a snack (S) for each voyage across mines. The robot can close down a mine only if it is at the same position as the mine. Initially the mines are open, and the goal is to close all the mines.

Describe briefly in STRIPS how to model the domain described. Include a specification of the parameters of the actions, and the preconditions and postconditions of each action. Include a description of the goal state of the problem, and create 1 possible initial state where the goal is reachable, and 1 possible initial state where the goal is not reachable. Your initial states need to have 3 or more snacks and 3 or more mines. Explain clearly any assumption made. You are allowed to use variables as arguments for the actions (action schemes), specifying the values of the variables. Note: it is not compulsory to use PDDL
